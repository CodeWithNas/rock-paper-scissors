# Rock Paper Scissors ðŸŽ®

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game made with JavaScript.

The game is played in the browser console. You play 5 rounds against the computer, and the winner is announced at the end.

This project is part of the JavaScript Foundations section from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## How to Play

2. A box will pop up asking you to type rock, paper, or scissors.
3. Check the browser console to see who won the round.
4. After 5 rounds, the final winner will be shown.

## What I Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Functions
- Conditionals (`if/else`)
- `prompt()` for user input
- `Math.random()` for random computer choices

## Notes

This is a practice project to help me understand how JavaScript works.  
Later on, I might turn this into a version with buttons and a real web interface.
